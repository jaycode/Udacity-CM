## AWS CodeBuild Triggers

We can initiate a build by the following triggers:

- **Frequency:** Triggering a build based on a time interval.
- **Programmatically:** Trigger programmatically. This is common with projects where there is an integration to manage build processes.
- **Web hooks:** Commonly used for GitHub. You may trigger a build when a pull request is opened, merged, or when a code is pushed. This is probably the most common type of trigger that is used in the industry.
