Now that we've set up engine x on our server, let's update this page.

Nothing fancy here, let's just change the displayed text.

Go back to the template, then write down the script to update the index page that is located in this directory.

This script creates an index.html file and moves it to the var/www/html directory.

This is the directory that hosts web pages by default in engine x.

At the end, reload engine x.

In this code, I also removed all the other index files in that particular directory. And only after that, I copied over the new index.html file.

One thing to note here is that we can't just update the template, but we need to delete the old one and recreate this whole cloud formation template.

The user data script will not be run after a cloud formation update.

In real-world application development, this whole server redeployment process is generally automated.

After running the creation script again we can check out CloudFormation to see that the creation is complete.

From this page, we can go to the load balancer page and just get the DNS again from there to copy and open on a browser.

And there you go.

We've updated the page.
