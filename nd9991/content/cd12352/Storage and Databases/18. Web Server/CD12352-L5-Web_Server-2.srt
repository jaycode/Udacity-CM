After setting up both the template and the profile, I ran the script.

And I got this message indicating that the script ran successfully.

Let's take a quick peek at the create udagram shell script.

So this script essentially accepts an argument which will then be passed over to the profile variable when the parameter is set.

The code that sets it up is right here.

Now let's move on to the last section of the code.

If the profile variable is not empty, it is going to pass it into the cloud formation create stack command right here.

Otherwise, it will run the command without the profile variable.

As a fun challenge, you may improve this part to reduce the duplicated code. 

Now let's see the cloud formation page.

Click refresh to see the current state.

Okay, so it's finished running. 

Now that we can access it, go to resources, and access your load balancer page by clicking its physical ID.

Click on this checkbox right before our newly created Load Balancer.

What we want to get from this page is the DNS name.

Now that we have the DNS name in our clipboard, I can pass it into the browser URL address to get this page.

Next, you need to update the text to meet one of the requirements in the rubric.
