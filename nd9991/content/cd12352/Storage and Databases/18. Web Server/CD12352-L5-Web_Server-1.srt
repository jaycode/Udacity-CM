Let's proceed with setting up our web server.

I'll now make some very minimal changes to get our Engine X server set up.

First of all, move the user data, the script here, from the starter file into your launch template data property. 

Right here

And also change the Image ID right here to the latest Ubuntu AMI.

Engine X uses port 80 by default, while we use port 3000

So let's change these two settings to port 80.

And also the port property of the target group for the load balancer right here.

Before pushing your update to Amazon, don't forget to set up your AWS configuration.

I prefer to set it up with a custom profile rather than using the default one, but feel free to do otherwise.

Throughout the rest of the lesson, I'll be using the "udacity" profile. Also, I use the credentials of the user I created on the console rather than the ones belonging to the federated user account.
