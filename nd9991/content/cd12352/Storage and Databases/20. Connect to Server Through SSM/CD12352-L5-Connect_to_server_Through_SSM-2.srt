Now that you got the SSM plugin installed, let's try to use it to connect to an EC2 server behind a private subnet.

But before that, let's try to set up or configure a profile.

As I mentioned earlier, I prefer to create a custom profile that uses the credentials of a new user I created on the AWS console.

When entering the default region name, pick the region associated with your account. It might be different from the one shown in this video.

Now that we've got the profile set, let's try to use it to connect to the server.

You may use the SSM start session option from the AWS CLI.

Add the target option.

And here you need to paste the ID of the EC2 instance.

On your AWS console, go to the EC2 page.

Click instances.

Then copy the ID of the instance created by the Auto Scaling Group.

Now let's paste it here.

Don't forget to include the profile option.

And there you go, you are connected to the server.
