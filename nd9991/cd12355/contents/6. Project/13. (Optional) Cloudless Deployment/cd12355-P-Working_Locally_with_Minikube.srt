I want to find out the pod that I will update by running the get pods command.

Now let's read the logs of this pod.

To do this, I can simply do the cube CTL logs command, followed by the name of the pod.

We are now going to add some text to this log, just to see if we can update our docker image.

In the code of the application, I will just add a hello message here.

Okay, when this works, you should see the hello message we just added around here in the log.

Before updating the docker image, let's make sure our shell is connected to mini cube's environment.

And then, we may now rebuild the docker image.

Now all we need to do is to delete the existing pod so that kubernet will recreate a pod with our new docker image.

Start by looking at the list of pods again. As before, we are using the cube CTL get pods command for this.

Copy the name, and paste it to the delete pods command.

Right after the pod is deleted, kubernet should almost instantly recreate another pod.

Now let's print out the logs of this newly created pod to see if the added message is there.

And there you go! The message is stored in the log.
