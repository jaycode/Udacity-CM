As you see here, I've copied the entire solution for the load-balancing web server exercise, and I haven't made any changes to it.

And I've also created several shell scripts to update UDAGRAM and the network templates.

Notice that there are four shell scripts here.
...
As an improvement, you may combine them into a single shell script from which it can do everything.

I've also created the network template.

I am not going to show the template in this video, but the diagram can be almost the same as the solution you've seen previously in the Network Infrastructure lesson, possibly with some minor updates to improve its usability.

For example, you may update its parameters and outputs.

On the CloudFormation console, you may see that I have run the network template.

Notice that the creation has been completed and all the resources are there.

The network template I use in this particular example is the one with two private subnets and two public subnets.
