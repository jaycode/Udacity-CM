## Copying content from the clipboard

There is a quirk in the workspace where it isn't possible to paste clipboard content into it. To workaround this issue, you may open the workspace in a new window.

First, click on **File**, then click **New Window.**

In the new window, open your workspace folder

On the terminal, when asked if you want to rewrite a README file, type in the answer `A` (meaning "Yes to All files").

After that step, you should then be able to paste values from your clipboard. When pasting for the first time, you will see a notification next to your URL. Click on "Allow" to allow pasting from the clipboard.

With pasting values from keyboard enabled, you may paste your AWS credentials when configuring your AWS CLI.
