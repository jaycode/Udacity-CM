A scatter plot titled "Defects of Space Shuttle O-rings." It has the x-axis labeled "Outside temperature (°F)" ranging from 20 to 90, and the y-axis labeled "Damage" at the top and "Pass" at the bottom. The plot features multiple blue dots indicating O-ring test results at different temperatures. At around 30°F, there is a single red dot labeled "Challenger launch" with an arrow pointing to it, indicating the temperature at which the Challenger space shuttle launched, highlighting a failure or defect in the O-ring. The other blue dots are clustered at higher temperatures, with no damage indicated.
