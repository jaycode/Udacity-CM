A screenshot from the video on the previous page shows a scatter plot, or more specifically called a bubble chart, as the data points have variable sizes. The x-axis of the chart represents income, labeled with logarithmic increments of $400, $4000, and $40,000, with the same distance between any two values. The y-axis represents lifespan, labeled in linear increments from 25 years to 75 years. The size of the bubbles encodes population, with larger bubbles representing larger populations. The color of the bubbles represents different continents. The movement of the bubbles suggests changes in the data over time.
