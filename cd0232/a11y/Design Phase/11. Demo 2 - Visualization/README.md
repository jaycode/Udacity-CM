A variety of graphs and charts, hand-drawn on a paper. At the top, there is a rough overlay of the dashboard. It is followed by a list of items to be presented on this dashboard, like the number of active users, number of hours in the system, user stats, etc. Right below it, there is a section called My 1st Extension, which contains several hand-drawn graphs and charts.
