The second part of the dashboard provides additional context to the earlier chart. This section consists solely of text, illustrating that an informative dashboard may include text-only segments to deliver summaries. The top text reads, "Narrowing the guest list down to only 25% still leaves us with HUGE numbers." Below, it states, "more people than the population of Hong Kong," followed by the number 7,726,132, which represents the population of Hong Kong. Next to this number is an icon of two people, one checking in the other. The bottom section reads, "guests checked into a rentable space for a total of 21,442,931 nights or 587 centuries." To the left of this text is an icon of a crescent moon and two stars, symbolizing nighttime.

The last part of the dashboard displaying the origins of guests to Germany while allowing readers to interact with it. The interactive part is placed at the bottom so it is harder to miss. The top section shows the 'Top 5 most common origins beside Germany,' with a bar chart listing the United States, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and Canada, ranging from 200K to 800K, with the United States having the highest count and Canada the lowest. The bottom section highlights the 'Rarest guests originated from...' with a bar chart listing Malta, Cyprus, Slovenia, Croatia, Iceland, and Canada, ranging from 20K to 100K, with Canada having the highest count and Malta the lowest.

Changing this input to other countries will change the last bar in both charts, so readers may compare their origin country with other most commmon and rarest origin countries.
