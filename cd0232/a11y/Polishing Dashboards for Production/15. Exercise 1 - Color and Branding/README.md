An uncolorized dashboard titled "2018 Sales Overview." It features filters for segment and state on the left side. The dashboard includes a bar chart displaying sales for various product sub-categories such as Phones, Chairs, and Storage, with values ranging from $0K to $200K. It also shows an annual trends line chart depicting monthly sales from January to December, with values ranging from $0K to $100K. One of the lines is darker than the rest, presumably from the latest year, which is 2018. Below, a table lists customer names, quantities purchased, sales figures, profit, profit ratios, and discount percentages. Examples include customers Aaron Bergman and Aaron Hawkins with their respective sales and profit details. The overall design provides a comprehensive view of sales data for the year 2018.
